Report: Installing Snort on Kali Linux

Introduction

This report outlines the steps to install Snort, a popular intrusion detection and prevention system, on Kali Linux. Please note that Snort is no longer available in Kali's repositories, so specific configurations are required to install it. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to successfully install Snort.
Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you have the following:

    A Kali Linux system with administrative privileges.
    Internet connectivity.

    Installation Steps
1. Backup Kali's Sources List

First, back up Kali's existing sources.list file as a precaution.

sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak

2. Remove Updates

Remove any existing update information to avoid conflicts during the installation.

find /var/lib/apt/lists -type f -exec rm {} \;

3. Modify Sources List

Open the sources.list file in a text editor.

sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list

Replace the existing content with one of the following options based on your system configuration:

For Non-Virtualized Systems:

deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu focal partner
deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu focal partner

For Virtual Machines (ARM Repositories):

deb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal main restricted universe multiverse
deb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb [arch=i386,amd64] http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse
deb [arch=i386,amd64] http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb [arch=i386,amd64] http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security main restricted universe multiverse

4. Add Public Keys

To ensure package authenticity, add the specified public keys.
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 871920D1991BC93C

5. Update Packages

Update the package list to reflect the changes in the sources list.

sudo apt update

6. Install Snort

Finally, install Snort using the following command:

sudo apt install snort

Troubleshooting

In some cases, you may encounter a "package unreachable" error during the update. To resolve this issue:

    Go to your preferred search engine and search for "Kali official mirror lists."

    Click on the second link that reads "Mirror Lists."

    The platform should detect your country and suggest an appropriate mirror. Choose a mirror written in a language you understand, and note the first two letters, such as "US."

    Return to your terminal.

    Change to the sources.list directory and open the sources.list file for editing (you can use any text editor, but in this example, we use vim).
cd /etc/apt/
sudo vim sources.list

    Paste the mirror link you obtained in step 3.

https://kali.download/kali/

Delete the "README" at the end of the link and add "kali-rolling main contrib non-free" to the end of the line, separated by a space.
https://kali.download/kali/ kali-rolling main contrib non-free

    Save and exit the text editor.

    Run an update to refresh the package lists.
sudo apt update

    Once the update is complete, proceed to install your desired package.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully install Snort on Kali Linux, even though it is no longer available in the default Kali repositories. Be sure to adapt the sources.list configuration to your system's architecture and mirror preferences.
